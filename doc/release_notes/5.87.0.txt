= New Features

* Column schema hashes on MySQL and PostgreSQL now include the
  comment on the column in the :comment entry.

* An inspect_pk plugin has been added, which makes the inspect output
  include the primary key next to the class name, so that you can
  copy and paste the inspect output to return the model object:

    Album.with_pk(1).inspect
    #         default: #<Album @values={...}>
    # with inspect_pk: #<Album[1] @values={...}>

* A pg_schema_caching extension has been added.  This builds on top
  of the schema_caching extension, and handles OIDs for custom types.

  Type OIDs are included in column schema hashes on PostgreSQL. The
  OIDs are static for built-in types, but dynamic for custom types.
  The pg_schema_caching extension will perform a query to get the
  type OIDs for the custom types after loading the cached schema.

= Other Improvements

* Database#extension and Dataset#extension no longer attempt to
  require the extension file if the extension has already been
  registered.  This is how model plugins work, and makes it easier
  for applications to use custom extensions without messing with the
  load path.

* When using the pg_auto_parameterize extension, and using
  Dataset#no_auto_parameterize, Dataset#import is no longer limited to
  inserting 40 rows at a time.

* The trilogy adapter now treats all database errors with code 1205 as
  Sequel::DatabaseLockTimeout.

= New Features

* A subset_static_cache plugin has been added, for statically caching
  subsets of a model class.  This is useful for cases where only a
  subset of the model class is static. For example, with this code:

    class StatusType < Sequel::Model
      dataset_module do
        where :available, hidden: false
      end
      cache_subset :available
     end

  The following methods will use the cache and not issue a database
  query:

  * StatusType.available.with_pk
  * StatusType.available.all
  * StatusType.available.each
  * StatusType.available.first (without block, only supporting no
    arguments or single integer argument)
  * StatusType.available.count (without an argument or block)
  * StatusType.available.map
  * StatusType.available.as_hash
  * StatusType.available.to_hash
  * StatusType.available.to_hash_groups

  The static_cache_cache plugin has been updated to statically cache
  these subsets, avoiding a query to get the static values when
  cache_subset is called.

* On PostgreSQL, column aliases now support data types, which is
  useful when selecting from functions returning records, such as
  the jsonb_to_record/jsonb_to_recordset function:

    DB.from{jsonb_to_recordset(:value).as(:d, [[:a, Integer], [:e, String]])}
    # SELECT * FROM jsonb_to_recordset("value") AS "d"("a" integer, "e" text)

= Other Improvements

* Sequel::Model class-level methods that call dataset methods can now
  be overridden by defining singleton methods on the class, and using
  super to get the default behavior (similar to how column and
  association methods work).

* The timestamp migrator now has deterministic behavior when multiple
  migrations have the same version, using a lexicographic sort of the
  rest of the migration filename to break ties.

* Explicit block parameters are now used in some methods, allowing
  the test suite to run without warnings when using
  -W:strict_unused_block on Ruby 3.4.

* A consistent instance variable setting order is now used in the
  string_agg extension to avoid shape-related performance warnings.
